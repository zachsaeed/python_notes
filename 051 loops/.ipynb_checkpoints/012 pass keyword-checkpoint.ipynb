    "Python pass statement\n",
    "You can consider python pass statement as no operation statement. The difference between Python comments and pass statement is; comments are being eliminated while interpreting the program but pass statement does not. It consumes execution cycle like a valid statement. For example, for printing only the odd numbers from a list, our program flow will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "List <- a list of number\n",
    "for each number in the list:\n",
    "\tif the number is even,\n",
    "\t\tthen, do nothing\n",
    "\telse \n",
    "\t\tprint odd number\n",
    "Now if we convert the above things to python,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Generate a list of number\n",
    "numbers = [ 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 10, 9 ]\n",
    "#Check for each number that belongs to the list\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "        #check if the number is even\n",
    "\tif number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "                #if even, then pass ( No operation )\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "\telse:\n",
    "                #print the odd numbers\n",

    "Suppose you need to implement many function one by one. But you have to check every function after implementing the function. Now if you leave the things like this:\n",

    "def func1():\n",
    "        # TODO: implement func1 later\n",

    "Why should we use Python pass Statement\n",
    "Now, a question may come to your mind, why should we use Python pass statement? Actually it seems that, in our previous example, if we just comment-out the unimplemented functions, like below, we will still get our desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#def func1():\n",

    "def func3(a):\n",
    "        print (a)\n",
    " \n",
    "func3(\"Hello\")\n",
    "But if you work with a huge python project, at one time, you may need something like pass statement. That’s why pass statement is introduced in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s all for today. Hope that, you learned well about Python pass statement. Stay tuned for our next tutorial and for any confusion, feel free to use the comment box."
