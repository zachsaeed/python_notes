    "## 1. Defining Superclass\n",
    "Line 1 â€“ 19 defines the superclass. You should have no trouble in understanding this if you are familiar with python class. Class Person is defined with necessary constructor, attributes and methods. Explanation of this segment has already been provided in Python Class tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Defining Subclass\n",
    "According to the rule of inheritance, the subclass inherits the attributes and methods of its superclass. Line 22 shows how subclass Student extends Person as its superclass. The name of superclass has to be kept in parentheses while declaring the subclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Subclass constructor\n",
    "And the constructor has to call the superclass constructor with appropriate attribute values (if needed) as shown in line 33. Apart from that, everything is the same as defining a normal python class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. creating objects of super class and subclass\n",
    "After defining both the superclass and the subclass, we may create objects of superclass and subclass as in lines 43 and 47. As we have been told earlier, the subclass inherits the attributes and methods. You may notice here that the object student1 (object of Student subclass) has the method showName under its scope (line 50).\n",
