    "Inheritance is included in almost every object-oriented programming languages. Python Inheritance enables us to use the member attributes and methods of one class into another or define a class which inherits from another class.\n",

    "We can use inheritance to define different categories datatypes in a tree like structure\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Inheritance Terminologies\n",
    "* *Super/parent/base class:** This is a top level class from which attributes and methods will be inherited. Common properties / members (attributes and methods) are usually defined in this base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Sub/child class:** These are classes/datatypes which inherit members from the superclass and in addition, define their own members which are specific to it's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "In python, inheritance works by passing the parrent class as an argument to the base class.\n",
