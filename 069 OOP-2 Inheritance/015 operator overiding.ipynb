    "Python Operators (arithmetuic boolean, comparion etc etc) work differently for different types of objects. This is achieved by special methods (also known as \"magic methods\" or \"dunder methods\", format: format __dunders__()) which we define in our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods give instructions to python for how to deal with objects when an operator is used on them. For example how 2 objects should be added etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- The + operator is shorthand for a special method called __add__() that gets called on the first operand and the second operand is passed as an argument.\n",
    "SO, var_1 + var_2 is internally running: var_1.__add__(var_2)\n",
    "- The default behaviour if the first (left) operand is an instance of int, __add__() does mathematical addition. If it's a string, it does string concatenation"
