    "# Paradigms of of Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main programming paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedural programming** in which codes are written in sequentially\n",
    "2. **Functional Programming** in which code is broken down into functions\n",
    "3. **Object-oriented programming** in which code is broken down into classes, objects and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm high-level programming language which means it supports procedural, functional and OOP programming. \n",
    "A programmer decides on the paradigm to use based on his expertise and the problems his trying to solve. However, there is no controversy that OOP makes programming easier, faster, more dynamic, and secured. This is a major reason C++, Java and Python are the top most popular programming languages in the world today\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn Java and Python or any other object-oriented programming languages, then you must understand these Object-Oriented Programming paradigms which are a relatively easy concept to understand. Let’s take a look at them.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP has the following concepts which are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. classes\n",
    "2. objects\n",
    "3. methods\n",
    "4. Encapsulation, \n",
    "5. Inheritance\n",
    "6. Polymorphism, \n",
    "7. Abstraction\n",
