    "| +(unary) | Represents a +ve value. It doesn’t really do anything. It mostly exists for the sake of completeness, to complement Unary Negation.| a<br>+a |\n",
    "| +(binary) | used to add two numbers | sum = a + b |\n",
    "| -(unary) | Represents a -ve value | -a |\n",
    "| –(binary) | used for subtraction | difference = a – b |\n",
    "| \\* | used to multiply two numbers. If a string and int is multiplied then the string is repeated the int times. | mul = a\\*b<br> >>> “Hi”\\*5<br> ‘HiHiHiHiHi’ |\n",
    "| / | used to divide two numbersThe result of standard division (/) is always a float, even if the dividend is evenly divisible by the divisor | div = b/a |\n",
    "| // | integer division. Same as / but the result is floored ie rounds it down. When the result of floor division (//) is positive, it is as though the fractional portion is truncated off, leaving only the integer portion.
