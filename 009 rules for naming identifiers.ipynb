    "## Rules for writing Identifiers\n",
    "There are some rules for writing Identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifiers can be combination of \n",
    "    * uppercase \n",
    "    * lowercase letters, \n",
    "    * digits \n",
    "    * underscore(_). \n",
    "    \n",
    "  So myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers. \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        _cats = 5\n",
    "        cats = 6\n",
    "        cats_123 = 10  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "* An Identifier can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        # 2cats = 5 #SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We canâ€™t use special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our Identifier.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        # cats@gmail = 5 #SyntaxError: can't assign to operator\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifiers are case-sensitive\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        CATS != cats\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifier can be of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices naming conventions:\n",
    "Though these are hard rules for writing identifiers, also there are some naming conventions which are not mandatory but rather good practices to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As per pep8 convention, \n",
    "    * class names need to be *CamelCase* \n",
    "    * while attribute and method names need to be *snake_case*\n",
    "    * constants should be CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE\n",
    "* Names should be self descriptive foe example, while c = 10 is valid, writing count = 10 would make more sense and it would be easier to figure out what it does even when you look at your code after a long time."
