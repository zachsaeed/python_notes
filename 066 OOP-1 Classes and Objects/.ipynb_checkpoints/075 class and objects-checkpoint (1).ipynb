    "Basic data types in python refer to only one kind of data at a time. By using classes, we can declare a data type which itself contains more than one data types and can work with them with the help of function. \n",

    "Python class is just a blueprint that defines a structure for a custom datatype. A class contains variables (Attributes) and methods. To use the classes, we create objects/instances which is a physical representation of a class in memory.\n",

    "## Simple Python Class Declaration\n",
    "Here’s the very basic structure of python class definition. A class contains the following 3 types of members:\n",

    "class ClassName:  \n",

Afterward, the first parameter must be ‘self’, as it passes a reference to the instance of the class itself.

    "# Python Class Object\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember, the number and type of parameters should be compatible with the parameters received in the constructor function.\n",
    "\n",
