    "# Class methods\n",
    "Class methods are methods (with the @classmethod decorator) that are not concerned with instances, but the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "All class methods take the reference to class-object as a first default parameter (just like instance methods take reference to instance-object as a first parameter). P.S. Python classes are instances and therefore objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot access 'self' (ref to instance-object) inside a class method as self-reference only comes into existence after instantiation. Therefore class methods can access only class attributes but not instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be only one copy of the class method regardless how many instances you create. They live in the class itself and are shared by the class and its instances. Therefore, can be accessed as:\n",
    "```<classname>.classmethod or <instancename>.classmethod```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are used when the method does not need to know bout the specific instance. Instance methods are the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** More about @decorators later. For now, @classmethod is an expression that goes on top of a method to turn it into a class method. For example:"
