    "As you can see, static methods don't need a reference to an instance (self) or a class (cls) as the first parameter. Therefore a static method can neither modify object state nor class state. Static methods are restricted in what data they can access - and they’re primarily a way to namespace your method\n",

    "## Uses of static methods:\n",
    "Static methods are used to create utility functions not w.r.t an Object but w.r.t the complete class. This is pretty much advantageous when we need to create Utility methods as they aren’t tied to an object lifecycle usually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of utility function can be some sort of independant processing / calculation that does not need access to cls or self. Like the calculate_pie function above."
