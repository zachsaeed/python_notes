Guest rooms were always hiding things. 
No one starts out wanting a guest room. 
It’s usually an office first, but then you got fired and can’t look at it anymore, so you throw a bed in it that you’ll never sleep in. 
Sometimes it’s a kid’s room, but they’ve moved out into a college dorm room. 
It used to be storage but then the divorce happened leaving it depressingly empty. 
A studio for recording music but the bass player was in a car accident, and the band broke up.

Guest rooms are rarely ever intentional. 
It’s more of a ritual. Something society has deemed necessary. 
The presumption that someone wants to stay with you and your new husband.
