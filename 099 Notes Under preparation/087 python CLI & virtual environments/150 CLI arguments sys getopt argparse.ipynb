    "# The CLI\n",
    "A command line interface (CLI) provides a way for a user to interact with a program running in a text-based shell interpreter. Some examples of shell interpreters are Bash on Linux or Command Prompt on Windows. A command line interface is enabled by the shell interpreter that exposes a command prompt. It can be characterized by the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A command or program\n",
    "* Zero or more command line arguments (which comprise of options, arguments and subcommands)\n",
    "* An output representing the result of the command\n",
    "* Textual documentation referred to as usage or help\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line shell of the operating system, the arguments that are given after the name of the program are known as Command Line Arguments. The complexity of the command line ranges from the ability to pass a single argument, to numerous arguments and options, much like a [Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). For example, some programs may launch web documentation from the command line or start an [interactive shell interpreter](https://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode) like Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Different operating system CLIs have different ways to escape arguments which is discussed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Escape in Linux CLI**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, whitespaces can be escaped by doing one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Surrounding the arguments with single quotes (')\n",
    "* Surrounding the arguments with double quotes (\")\n",
    "* Prefixing each space with a backslash (\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without one of the escape solutions, reverse.py stores two arguments, \"Real\" in sys.argv[1] and \"Python\" in sys.argv[2]:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python reverse.py Real Python\n",
    "laeR\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output above shows that the script only reverses \"Real\" and that \"Python\" is ignored. To ensure both arguments are stored, you’d need to surround the overall string with double quotes (\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a backslash (\\) to escape the whitespace:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python reverse.py Real\\ Python\n",
    "nohtyP laeR\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the backslash (\\), the command shell exposes a unique argument to Python, and then to reverse.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Escape in Unix CLI**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix shells, the internal field separator (IFS) shell variable, pre-defines the characters which the CLI will treat as delimiters. The content of the shell variable, IFS, can be displayed by running the following command:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ printf \"%q\\n\" \"$IFS\"\n",
    "$' \\t\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "From the result above, ' \\t\\n', we can identify three delimiters:\n",
    "* Space (' ')\n",
    "* Tab (\\t)\n",
    "* Newline (\\n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, unix will treat the space in 'real python' as a delimiter and as a result, 2 separate blocks of text arguments \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python reverse.py Real Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefixing a space with a backslash (\\) bypasses the default behavior of the space as a delimiter in the string \"Real Python\". This results in one block of text as intended, instead of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the value of IFS and define our own delimiter\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$IFS = ;\n",
    "$ python reverse.py Real;Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "since, ; is a delimiter, again CLI will treat Real and Python as 2 separate blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Escape in windows CLI**\n",
    "In Windows, the whitespace interpretation can be managed by using a combination of double quotes. It’s slightly counterintuitive because, in the Windows terminal, a double quote (\") is interpreted as a switch to disable and subsequently to enable special characters like **space, tab, or pipe (|)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, when you surround more than one string with double quotes, the Windows terminal interprets the first double quote as a command to **ignore special characters** and the second double quote as one to **interpret special characters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information in mind, it’s safe to assume that surrounding more than one string with double quotes will give you the expected behavior, which is to expose the group of strings as a single argument. To confirm this peculiar effect of the double quote on the Windows command line, observe the following two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "C:/>python reverse.py \"Real Python\"\n",
    "nohtyP laeR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, you can intuitively deduce that \"Real Python\" is interpreted as a single argument. However, realize what occurs when you use a single double quote:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "C:/>python reverse.py \"Real Python\n",
    "nohtyP laeR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command prompt passes the whole string \"Real Python\" as a single argument, in the same manner as if the argument was \"Real Python\". In reality, the Windows command prompt sees the unique double quote as a switch to disable the behavior of the whitespaces as separators and passes anything following the double quote as a unique argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the effects of double quotes in the Windows terminal, check out [A Better Way To Understand Quoting and Escaping of Windows Command Line Arguments](http://www.windowsinspired.com/understanding-the-command-line-string-and-arguments-received-by-a-windows-program/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Errors\n",
    "Python command line arguments are **loose strings**. Many things can go wrong, so it’s a good idea to provide the users of your program with some guidance in the event they pass incorrect arguments at the command line. For example, reverse.py expects one argument, and if you omit it, then you get an error:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python reverse.py\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"reverse.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    arg = sys.argv[1]\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Python [exception](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/) IndexError is raised, and the corresponding [traceback](https://realpython.com/python-traceback/) shows that the error is caused by the expression arg = sys.argv[1]. The message of the exception is list index out of range. You didn’t pass an argument at the command line, so there’s nothing in the list sys.argv at index 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common pattern that can be addressed in a few different ways. For this initial example, you’ll keep it brief by including the expression arg = sys.argv[1] in a try block. Modify the code as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# reverse_exc.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    arg = sys.argv[1]  # The expression is included in a try block.\n",
    "except IndexError:\n",
    "    raise SystemExit(f\"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <string_to_reverse>\")  # This line raises the built-in exception SystemExit.\n",
    "print(arg[::-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "If no argument is passed to reverse_exc.py, then the process exits with a status code of 1 after printing the usage. Note the integration of sys.argv[0] in the error message. It exposes the name of the program in the usage message. Now, when you execute the same program without any Python command line arguments, you can see the following output:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python reverse.py\n",
    "Usage: reverse.py <string_to_reverse>\n",
    "\n",
    "$ echo $?\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "reverse.py didn’t have an argument passed at the command line. As a result, the program raises SystemExit with an error message. This causes the program to exit with a status of 1, which displays when you print the special variable $? with echo."

    "## The Anatomy of Python Command Line Arguments\n",
    "The syntax for command line arguments follows some standards that are regularly used by developers while implementing a command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python command line arguments are a subset of the command line interface. They can be composed of different types of arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Options** modify the behavior of a particular command or program.\n",
    "2. **Arguments** represent the source or destination to be processed.\n",
    "3. **Subcommands** allow a program to define more than one command with the respective set of options and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go deeper into the different types of arguments, we’ll get an overview of the accepted standards that have been guiding the design of the command line interface and arguments. These have been refined since the advent of the computer terminal in the mid-1960s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standards\n",
    "A few available standards provide some definitions and guidelines to promote consistency for implementing commands and their arguments. These are the main UNIX standards and references:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [POSIX Utility Conventions](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html)\n",
    "* [GNU Standards for Command Line Interfaces](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Command_002dLine-Interfaces)\n",
    "* [docopt](http://docopt.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standards above define guidelines and nomenclatures for anything related to programs and Python command line arguments. The following points are examples taken from those references:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### POSIX:\n",
    "* A program or utility is followed by options, option-arguments, and operands.\n",
    "* All options should be preceded with a hyphen or minus (-) delimiter character.\n",
    "* Option-arguments should not be optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GNU:\n",
    "* The GNU standards are very similar to the POSIX standards but provide some modifications and extensions below:\n",
    "* All programs should support two standard options, which are --version and --help.\n",
    "* Long-named options are equivalent to the single-letter Unix-style options. An example is --debug and -d.\n",
    "\n",
    "### docopt:\n",
    "* Short options can be stacked, meaning that -abc is equivalent to -a -b -c.\n",
    "* Long options can have arguments specified after a space or the equals sign (=). The long option --input=ARG is equivalent to --input ARG.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You don’t need to follow those standards rigorously. Instead, follow the conventions that have been used successfully for years since the advent of UNIX. If you write a set of utilities for you or your team, then ensure that you stay consistent across the different utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, you’ll learn more about each of the command line components, options, arguments, and sub-commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options\n",
    "An **option**, sometimes called a **flag** or a **switch**, is intended to modify the behavior of the program. For example, the command ls on Linux lists the content of a given directory. Without any arguments, it lists the files and directories in the current directory:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ cd /dev\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "autofs\n",
    "block\n",
    "bsg\n",
    "btrfs-control\n",
    "bus\n",
    "char\n",
    "console\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s add a few options. You can combine -l and -s into -ls, which changes the information displayed in the terminal:\n",
    "```console\n",

    "An **option** can take an argument, which is called an **option-argument**. See an example in action with [od](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Od_%28Unix%29) below:\n",

In the example above, it takes the binary file main and displays the first 16 bytes of the file in hexadecimal format. The option -t expects a type as an option-argument, and -N expects the number of input bytes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Arguments\n",
    "**arguments** are also called **operands** or [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#Computing) in the POSIX standards. The arguments represent the source or the destination of the data that the command acts on. For example, the command [cp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_%28Unix%29), which is used to copy one or more files to a file or a directory, takes at least one source and one target:\n",
    "```console\n",

    "main2\n",
    "...\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **main:** the source file\n",
    "2. **main2:** the target file\n",
    "It then copies the content of main to a new file named main2. Both main and main2 are arguments, or operands, of the program cp.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subcommands\n",
    "The concept of **subcommands** isn’t documented in the POSIX or GNU standards, but it does appear in **docopt**. The standard Unix utilities are small tools adhering to the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). Unix programs are intended to be programs that [do one thing and do it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well). This means no subcommands are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, a new generation of programs, including [git](https://git-scm.com/), [go](https://golang.org/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/), come with a slightly different paradigm that embraces subcommands. They’re not necessarily part of the Unix landscape as they span several operating systems, and they’re deployed with a full ecosystem that requires several commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take git as an example. It handles several commands, each possibly with their own set of options, option-arguments, and arguments. The following examples apply to the git subcommand branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git branch** displays the branches of the local git repository.\n",
    "* **git branch custom_python** creates a local branch custom_python in a local repository.\n",
    "* **git branch -d custom_python** deletes the local branch custom_python.\n",
    "* **git branch --help** displays the help for the git branch subcommand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python ecosystem, pip has the concept of subcommands, too. Some [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29) subcommands include *list*, *install*, *freeze*, or *uninstall*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "On Windows, the conventions regarding Python command line arguments are slightly different, in particular, those regarding [command line options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Option_conventions_in_DOS,_Windows,_OS/2). To validate this difference, take *tasklist*, which is a native Windows executable that displays a list of the currently running processes. It’s similar to ps on Linux or macOS systems. Below is an example of how to execute tasklist in a command prompt on Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "C:/>tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq notepad.exe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage\n",
    "========================= ======== ================ =========== ============\n",
    "notepad.exe                  13104 Console                    6     13,548 K\n",
    "notepad.exe                   6584 Console                    6     13,696 K\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the separator for an option is a forward slash (/) instead of a hyphen (-) like the conventions for Unix systems. For readability, there’s a space between the program name, taskslist, and the option /FI, but it’s just as correct to type taskslist/FI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular example above executes tasklist with a filter to only show the Notepad processes currently running. You can see that the system has two running instances of the Notepad process. Although it’s not equivalent, this is similar to executing the following command in a terminal on a Unix-like system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ ps -ef | grep vi | grep -v grep\n",
    "andre     2117     4  0 13:33 tty1     00:00:00 vi .gitignore\n",
    "andre     2163  2134  0 13:34 tty3     00:00:00 vi main.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ps command above shows all the current running vi processes. The behavior is consistent with the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), as the output of ps is transformed by two grep filters. The first grep command selects all the occurrences of vi, and the second grep filters out the occurrence of grep itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the spread of Unix tools making their appearance in the Windows ecosystem, non-Windows-specific conventions are also accepted on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visuals\n",
    "At the start of a Python process, Python command line arguments are split into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python options:** These influence the execution of the Python interpreter. For example, adding option [-O](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-o) is a means to optimize the execution of a Python program by removing assert and __debug__ statements. There are other [Python options](https://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#interface-options) available at the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python program and its arguments:** Following the Python options (if there are any), you’ll find the Python program, which is a file name that usually has the extension .py, and its arguments. By convention, those can also be composed of options and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following command that’s intended to execute the program main.py, which takes options and arguments. Note that, in this example, the Python interpreter also takes some options, which are [-B](https://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#id1) and [-v](https://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#id4).\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python -B -v main.py --verbose --debug un deux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line above, the options are Python command line arguments and are organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The option -B** tells Python not to write .pyc files on the import of source modules. For more details about .pyc files, check out the section [What Does a Compiler Do?](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#what-does-a-compiler-do) in [Your Guide to the CPython Source Code](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide).\n",
    "* **The option -v** stands for **verbose** and tells Python to trace all import statements.\n",
    "* **The arguments passed to main.py** are fictitious and represent two long options (--verbose and --debug) and two arguments (un and deux).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example of Python command line arguments can be illustrated graphically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./assets/017_CLI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Python program main.py, you only have access to the Python command line arguments inserted by Python in sys.argv. The Python options may influence the behavior of the program but are not accessible in main.py."

    "## A Few Methods for Parsing Python Command Line Arguments\n",
    "Now you’re going to explore a few approaches to apprehend options, option-arguments, and operands. This is done by parsing Python command line arguments. In this section, you’ll see some concrete aspects of Python command line arguments and techniques to handle them. First, you’ll see an example that introduces a straight approach relying on [list comprehensions](https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/) to collect and separate options from arguments. Then you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use regular expressions to extract elements of the command line\n",
    "* Learn how to handle files passed at the command line\n",
    "* Apprehend the standard input in a way that’s compatible with the Unix tools\n",
    "* Differentiate the regular output of the program from the errors\n",
    "* Implement a custom parser to read Python command line arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "This will serve as a preparation for options involving modules in the standard libraries or from external libraries that you’ll learn about later in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For something uncomplicated, the following pattern, which doesn’t enforce ordering and doesn’t handle option-arguments, may be enough:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# cul.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#. The code collects and separates the different argument types using list comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",

    "args = [arg for arg in sys.argv[1:] if not arg.startswith(\"-\")]  # assembles the program arguments by filtering out the options.\n",

    "* -u to convert the arguments to uppercase\n",
    "* -l to convert the argument to lowercase\n",

    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "You can use a regular expression to enforce a certain order, specific options and option-arguments, or even the type of arguments. To illustrate the usage of a regular expression to parse Python command line arguments, you’ll implement a Python version of seq, which is a program that prints a sequence of numbers. Following the docopt conventions, a specification for seq.py could be this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Print integers from <first> to <last>, in steps of <increment>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "  python seq.py --help\n",
    "  python seq.py [-s SEPARATOR] <last>\n",
    "  python seq.py [-s SEPARATOR] <first> <last>\n",
    "  python seq.py [-s SEPARATOR] <first> <increment> <last>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.\n",
    "  -s, --separator=STRING use STRING to separate numbers (default: \\n)\n",
    "      --help             display this help and exit\n",
    "\n",
    "If <first> or <increment> are omitted, they default to 1. When <first> is\n",
    "larger than <last>, <increment>, if not set, defaults to -1.\n",
    "The sequence of numbers ends when the sum of the current number and\n",
    "<increment> reaches the limit imposed by <last>.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, look at a regular expression that’s intended to capture the requirements above:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "args_pattern = re.compile(\n",
    "    r\"\"\"\n",
    "    ^\n",
    "    (\n",
    "        (--(?P<HELP>help).*)|\n",
    "        ((?:-s|--separator)\\s(?P<SEP>.*?)\\s)?\n",
    "        ((?P<OP1>-?\\d+))(\\s(?P<OP2>-?\\d+))?(\\s(?P<OP3>-?\\d+))?\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "    re.VERBOSE,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "To experiment with the regular expression above, you may use the snippet recorded on Regular Expression 101. The regular expression captures and enforces a few aspects of the requirements given for seq. In particular, the command may take:\n",
    "\n",
    "A help option, in short (-h) or long format (--help), captured as a named group called HELP\n",
    "A separator option, -s or --separator, taking an optional argument, and captured as named group called SEP\n",
    "Up to three integer operands, respectively captured as OP1, OP2, and OP3\n",
    "For clarity, the pattern args_pattern above uses the flag re.VERBOSE on line 11. This allows you to spread the regular expression over a few lines to enhance readability. The pattern validates the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Argument order: Options and arguments are expected to be laid out in a given order. For example, options are expected before the arguments.\n",
    "Option values**: Only --help, -s, or --separator are expected as options.\n",
    "Argument mutual exclusivity: The option --help isn’t compatible with other options or arguments.\n",
    "Argument type: Operands are expected to be positive or negative integers.\n",
    "For the regular expression to be able to handle these things, it needs to see all Python command line arguments in one string. You can collect them using str.join():\n",
    "\n",
    "arg_line = \" \".join(sys.argv[1:])\n",
    "This makes arg_line a string that includes all arguments, except the program name, separated by a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the pattern args_pattern above, you can extract the Python command line arguments with the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def parse(arg_line: str) -> Dict[str, str]:\n",
    "    args: Dict[str, str] = {}\n",
    "    if match_object := args_pattern.match(arg_line):\n",
    "        args = {k: v for k, v in match_object.groupdict().items()\n",
    "                if v is not None}\n",
    "    return args\n",
    "The pattern is already handling the order of the arguments, mutual exclusivity between options and arguments, and the type of the arguments. parse() is applying re.match() to the argument line to extract the proper values and store the data in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary includes the names of each group as keys and their respective values. For example, if the arg_line value is --help, then the dictionary is {'HELP': 'help'}. If arg_line is -s T 10, then the dictionary becomes {'SEP': 'T', 'OP1': '10'}. You can expand the code block below to see an implementation of seq with regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you know a few ways to extract options and arguments from the command line. So far, the Python command line arguments were only strings or integers. Next, you’ll learn how to handle files passed as arguments.\n",

Before you try getting help from specific libraries, another approach is to create a custom parser. The parser is a loop that fetches each argument one after another and applies a custom logic based on the semantics of your program.\n",

    "            raise SystemExit(USAGE)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return separator, operands\n",
    "parse() is given the list of arguments without the Python file name and uses collections.deque() to get the benefit of .popleft(), which removes the elements from the left of the collection. As the items of the arguments list unfold, you apply the logic that’s expected for your program. In parse() you can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is at the core of the function, and terminates when there are no more arguments to parse, when the help is invoked, or when an error occurs.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Few Methods for Validating Python Command Line Arguments\n",
    "You’ve already performed validation for Python command line arguments in a few examples like seq_regex.py and seq_parse.py. In the first example, you used a regular expression, and in the second example, a custom parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these examples took the same aspects into account. They considered the expected options as short-form (-s) or long-form (--separator). They considered the order of the arguments so that options would not be placed after operands. Finally, they considered the type, integer for the operands, and the number of arguments, from one to three arguments.\n",
