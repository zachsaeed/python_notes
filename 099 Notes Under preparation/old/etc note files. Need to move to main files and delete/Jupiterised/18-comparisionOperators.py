# The comparision operators

# >=, <=
# compare the values of two objects and return either True or False.

# The objects need not have the same type. If both are numbers, they are converted to a common type. Otherwise, objects
# of different types always compare unequal, and are ordered consistently but arbitrarily.
# Note
print('A' < 'a')  # True (ASCII table value comparison)
