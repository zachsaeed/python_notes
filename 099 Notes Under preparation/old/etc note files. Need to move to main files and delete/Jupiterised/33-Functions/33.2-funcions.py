# Function is a process for executing a task
# It can accept inputs and returns an output
# Creates a reusable set of procedures which can be called and executed over and over
# helps implement DRY - dont repeat yourself as opposed to WET - write everything twice
# helps cleanup and avoid code duplication
# abstracts away code for other users
# allows us to organise things

# pep:8:
# 1- most variables should be lower_snake_case (not camelCase)
# 2- leave 2 lines b4 and after method definition


# structure
# def name_of_function ():
#   block of runnable code

# definition
def say_hi():
    print('Hi')

# call/invoke function:
say_hi()
