    "Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by storing them in folders and access using “dotted module names”. For example, the module name A.B designates a submodule named B in a package named A. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other’s module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as modules are way of handling functions and namespace in a better way, in that way python package is the way of handling two or more modules in a structured method.\n",

    "Suppose you want to design a collection of modules for handling the music files. Here’s a possible structure for your package (expressed in terms of a hierarchical filesystem):\n",

    "Every package directory needs to have an \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py file, which will ensure that this directory will be treated as a python package. \n",

    "* just an empty file or \n",

    "Or,\n",
    "```python\n",

    "> when using syntax like ```import item.subitem.subsubitem```, each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.\n",
    "> when using ```from package import item```, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable. The import statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.\n",

    "# import * From a Python Package\n",
    "If one writes ```from music.formats import *``` inorder to import all the submidules under this package (like we did while importing from a module), this will consume a lot of time and cause unwanted side-effects, therefore, it is not allowed unless \\_\\_all\\_\\_ list is defined in the __init__.py file)\n",
    "\n",
    "The package author can optionally provide an explicit index of the package by defining a list named \\_\\_all\\_\\_ inside the package’s \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py file. The \\_\\_all\\_\\_ list would be considered as the index of module names that should be imported when ```from music.formats import * ``` is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the file music/effects/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py could contain the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\\_\\_all\\_\\_ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would mean that ```from music.effects import *``` would import the three named submodules of the sound package. The rest of the sub modules and variables will be ignored and will need to be imported explicitly using a separate import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\_\\_all\\_\\_ is not defined, there is guarantee that all the submodules under it will be imported. It only ensures that the package music.effects has been imported with possibly running any initialization code in \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use import *, it is still considered bad practice in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, there is nothing wrong with using from package import specific_submodule! In fact, this is the recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from different packages.\n",
